                    My name is Boni Rosales, but I like to go by Bo. I am currently a Web Developer at University Federal Credit Union in Summer of 2018 I joined the UT Coding Boot Camp and that started as my introduction to web development. I thoroughly enjoy what I do
                    and am constantly looking to grow. I have developed projects for those languages and have developed some code in React as well, though I am still new to it. I look forward to potentially working together.
